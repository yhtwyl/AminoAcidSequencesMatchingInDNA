# Amino acid sequences matching
This python code takes two DNA sequences, called Query and Subject. Incrementally matches the fixed length(N) of continuous amino acids in Query sequence with the Subject sequence. Then it merges the matches which are adjacent to each other and finally writes the output to a file, here named "merged.out".
What you have to do is place the Query and subject sequence files, downloaded from ncbm in fasta format, along with the main program in one single directory. Edit the names of Query and Subject sequnces in the program.py.
Run the program using python compiler, I have tested it on python3.6.
You can also edit the names of output files according to your wish.
